# Password Strength Classification

This project involves analyzing and predicting the strength of passwords using machine learning techniques. The code provided demonstrates how to preprocess password data, perform feature extraction, train a classification model, and evaluate its performance.

## Overview

The main tasks performed in this project include:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load password strength data, handle missing values, and visualize data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Use TF-IDF vectorization to transform passwords into feature vectors.
3. **Model Training and Prediction**: Train a logistic regression model to classify password strength.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

**Prepare the Data**

Make sure you have the data.csv file in the appropriate directory (/content/drive/MyDrive/Password Strength/), or update the path in the code accordingly.

**Run the Notebook**

Open the notebook file Password Strength.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run the cells to execute the analysis.
